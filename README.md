**Exploring COVID-19 Data: A Comprehensive Analysis**

**Introduction:**
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a big and challenging problem worldwide. It affected many people and caused changes in our daily lives. This project is all about looking at the information we have about COVID-19 to learn important things. This portfolio project delves into the realm of COVID-19 data analysis, aiming to uncover valuable insights, trends, and patterns from a rich dataset. By harnessing the power of SQL queries, this project explores various facets of the pandemic, including vaccination rates, infection and death rates. 

**Project Highlights:**

**Data:**
COVID-19 data, vaccination data and vaccination meta data were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO)(https://covid19.who.int/)
Population and continents data were sourced from Our World in Data(https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth)

**Data Preparation:**
Enriched the COVID-19 data with continents information using EXCEL’s VLOOKUP function.
The data was imported into SQL Server using SQL Server Integration Services(SSIS) in visual studio for advanced analysis.

**Data Exploration in SQL:**
Conducted an in-depth data exploration using SQL queries. Refer to the files ‘CovidDeathsSQLQuery’ and ‘CovidVaccinationsSQLQuery’  for the detailed SQL Queries.
